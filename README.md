# Theory-of-Computation-and-Compiler-Design
Provides Information regarding Theory Of Computation And Compiler Design taught at VIT (VIT BHOPAL UNIVERSITY)
(VELLORE INSTITYTE OF TECHNOLOGY)

### Course Instructor- Dr. Paras Jain

# Overview



(1)


Basic concepts – Theorem proving – Finite automata: NFA,
DFA, € - NFA, Regular expressions - Equivalence between FA
and RE – Minimization – Decision properties – Pumping
lemma for Regular Languages.
Problems: Design of FA – Inter-conversion between RE and
FA – Proving languages to be not regular



(2)


Specification of tokens – FA and RE to represent token formats – LEX.
Context Free Grammar – Derivations – Parse trees –
Ambiguity – Pushdown Automata – DPDA & NPDA –
Decision properties – Pumping lemma for CFL.
Problems: Design of CFG – Design of PDA – Inter-conversion
between PDA & CFG – Proving languages to be not context-
free



(3)


Chomsky Normal Form – Griebach Normal Form – Parsing –
Top-down Parsing – Predictive Parsing - Bottom up parsing –
SLR, CLR and LALR Parsing – YACC.
Problems: Conversion from CFG to CNF, GNF – Parsing



(4)


Turing machines – TM as a computation model – TM as a
recognizer – TM with multiple tapes – Other models of TM –
Linear Bounded Automata.
Three Address Codes – Code optimization techniques.
Problems: Design of TM – Design of LBA – Conversion from
parse tree to TAC – optimization techniques



(5)


Chomsky Hierarchy of languages – Undecidability – Recursive
and non – recursive languages – Examples - Code generation.
Problems: Identification of Undecidability – Code generation
